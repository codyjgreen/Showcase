#### Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it if necessary.

_Why:_
> Group projects can be stressful and emotions can run high. Put together a plan ahead of time so you all know how to deal with any potential issues later.

As a team, we are going to create a Group Agreement as a markdown file to document the following:

* What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
* What is your process to resolve conflicts?
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?

#### Communication Plan

Before beginning to write code, determine how your group will communicate with each other, both in person and online.

_Why:_
> This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone knows how the group will communicate with each other and that everyone feels comfortable speaking up.

Add your communication plan to your Group Agreement. Some things to consider:

* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
