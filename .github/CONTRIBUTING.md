# Contributing Guide
:tada: Thank you for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Project Showcase
React app. This is a project built by the Alumni over at Flatiron
School Seattle. Remember, these are guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement, and
feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Before Getting Started

We utilize the [Project section](https://github.com/codyjgreen/Showcase-Front/projects)
on GitHub for our the Showcase App. There are 5 columns within our project.

- **Icebox**: "Not going to be developed anytime soon"
- **To Do**: "Active issues that are open for self-assignment"
- **In Progress**: "Assigned issues with code pushed to a branch"
- **Code Review**: "Completed code that the assignees have requested a review for"
- **Done**: "Code closing the issue has been merged to master"

## Contribution Workflow

Here you can learn about the typical process you will go through as far as contributing
to the Learn Together App:

1. Create an issue in To Do

  - Begin by either [creating an issue through the issue page](https://github.com/codyjgreen/Showcase-Front/issues/new)
  OR [creating a card in the Project page](https://github.com/codyjgreen/Showcase-Front/projects/1)
and converting it into an issue.
  - Write the issue as a user story, such as "As a student,
I should be able to add information about my project in a form".
  - **Opening an issue doesn't
mean you have to be assigned to it**.
  - However once assigned to an issue, you are the main driver till it's reviewed and merged into the `master` branch.

2. Assign yourself to an issue in To Do

  - If you want a partner, ask them prior to assigning them into an issue.
  - If issues sit assigned in To Do for a week with no movement, they may be reassigned.
    (Don't worry, we know you have lives)
  -  Icebox issues are last in line.

3. Move issues to In Progress

  - Once you have code pushed to a remote branch, move your To Do issue to In Progress.
  - If you want an extra set of eyes on your code, slack it to #showcase-app-hack
  and ask for it.

4. Move issues to Code Review

  - If your code solves the issue, move it to Code Review and assign a reviewer who
  did not code it with you.
  - Feel free to assign anyone to review.
  - If people get assigned to review and don't/can't review it, let the coders know
  so they can ask for a review elsewhere.
  - *Optional*: set a time to sit with reviewer and walk through code real-time instead
  of asynchronously.

5. Move issue to Done

- Once an issue has passed review, move it to Done
  - If you want the experience of merging into master, you can merge it into master yourself
  - Once we get the app set up we can deploy it to heroku and have it auto deploy on push to master
